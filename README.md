# Goku

(name was chosen for no reason other than "starts with Go-")

This is a toy neural network project. I'm learning Go and wanted something interesting to play around with.

The "logic gate tests" were pulled straight from Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

## TODO

- [ ] Simplify creating a network
    - [ ] `neuron.Layer` for simple layer-based NN setup
- [ ] Maybe introduce a Bias node
- [ ] Rename some packages/types
