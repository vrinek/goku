# Goku

(name was chosen for no reason other than "starts with Go-")

This is a toy neural network project. I'm learning Go and wanted something interesting to play around with.

The "logic gate tests" were pulled straight from Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

## TODO

- [x] Simplify creating a network
    - [x] `neuron.Layer` for simple layer-based NN setup
- [ ] Maybe introduce a Bias node
- [ ] Add some proper documentation
- [ ] Rename some packages/types
- [ ] Training!
